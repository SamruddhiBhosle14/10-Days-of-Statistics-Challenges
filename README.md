####[Day 2: Basic Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
<br><br>
**Ans:** ***30/36 = 5/6***
<br>
<br>

####[Day 2: More Dice](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-2/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6. 
<br><br>
**Ans:** ***4/36 = 1/9***
<br>
<br>

####[Day 2: Compound Event Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-3/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

    Urn contains red balls and black balls.
    Urn contains red balls and black balls.
    Urn contains red balls and black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
<br><br>
**Ans:** <br>

    Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball. 
    Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball. 
    Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball. 
    
    Urn X has a 3/7 probability of giving a black ball.
    Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball. 
    Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball. 

    =>P(2 red, 1 black) 
    = P(Red Red Black) + P(Red Black Red) + P(Black Red Red) 
    = (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)
    = 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 
    = 51/126 
    = 17/42  
    
<br>

### Day 3

####[Day 3: Conditional Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-4/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?
<br><br>
**Ans:** <br>

    Approach is to reduce the sample space so that it only contains events where one child is a boy 
    S(boy) = {BB, GB, BG}. If we consider event E to be the event in which both children are boys (so E = {BB}), 
    we can find the probability as a fraction of the reduced sample space:
                        P(E) = |E|/|S| = 1/3.
                        
<br>

####[Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-5/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?
<br><br>
**Ans:** <br>

    The first card drawn will be from any of the 4 suits and there will be 51 cards left in the deck, 
    only 12 of which match the drawn card's suit. The probability of the second card being of the same suit is:
                        P(E) = 12/51 = 4/17.
                        
<br>

####[Day 3: Drawing Marbles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-6/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?
<br><br>
**Ans:** <br>

    since already 1 ball is choosen, there are 6 balls left. We need to pick up the blue ball, 
    where there are 4 blue coloured balls. The probabilty is P(E) = 4/6 = 2/3.

**Task:** <br>
The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

    The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88. The daily cost of operating
    A is Ca = 160 + 40X^2.
    The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55. The daily cost of operating
    B is Cb = 128 + 40Y^2.

Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day. Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.
