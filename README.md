####[Day 0: Mean, Median, and Mode](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-basic-statistics/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective ***mean, median, and mode*** on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-0/Day-0_MeanMedianAndMode.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 0: Weighted Mean](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-weighted-mean/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the ***weighted mean*** of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of decimal place.

####[Day 1: Quartiles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-quartiles/problem)
<br>
**Task:**<br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate the respective ***first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3)***. It is guaranteed that Q1, Q2, and Q3 are integers.
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-1/Day-1_Quartiles.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 1: Interquartile Range](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-interquartile-range/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e., Q3-Q1). <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, F, representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, construct a data set, X, where each Xi occurs at frequency Fi. Then calculate and print S's ***interquartile range***, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-1/Day-1_InterquartileRange.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 1: Standard Deviation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-standard-deviation/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the ***standard deviation***. Your answer should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format). An error margin of +-0.1 will be tolerated for the standard deviation.
