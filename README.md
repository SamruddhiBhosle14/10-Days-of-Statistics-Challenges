####[Day 0: Mean, Median, and Mode](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-basic-statistics/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the respective ***mean, median, and mode*** on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-0/Day-0_MeanMedianAndMode.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 0: Weighted Mean](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-weighted-mean/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, W, representing the respective weights of X's elements, calculate and print the ***weighted mean*** of X's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of decimal place.
<br><br>

####[Day 1: Quartiles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-quartiles/problem)
<br>
**Task:**<br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate the respective ***first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3)***. It is guaranteed that Q1, Q2, and Q3 are integers.
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-1/Day-1_Quartiles.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 1: Interquartile Range](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-interquartile-range/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e., Q3-Q1). <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers and an array, F, representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, construct a data set, X, where each Xi occurs at frequency Fi. Then calculate and print S's ***interquartile range***, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-1/Day-1_InterquartileRange.cpp)
<br>
<br>

####[Day 1: Standard Deviation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-standard-deviation/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the ***standard deviation***. Your answer should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format). An error margin of +-0.1 will be tolerated for the standard deviation.
<br><br>
[Solution](https://github.com/SrGrace/10-Days-of-Statistics-Challenges/blob/master/Day-1/Day-1_StandardDeviation.cpp)
<br>

####[Day 2: Basic Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
<br><br>
**Ans:** ***30/36 = 5/6***
<br>
<br>

####[Day 2: More Dice](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-2/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6. 
<br><br>
**Ans:** ***4/36 = 1/9***
<br>
<br>

####[Day 2: Compound Event Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-3/problem)
<br>
**Task:** <br>
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

    Urn contains red balls and black balls.
    Urn contains red balls and black balls.
    Urn contains red balls and black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
<br><br>
**Ans:** <br>
Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball. <br>
Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball. <br>
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball. 
<br>
Urn X has a 3/7 probability of giving a black ball. <br>
Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball. <br>
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball. <br>

=>P(2 red, 1 black) <br>
= P(Red Red Black) + P(Red Black Red) + P(Black Red Red) <br>
= (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2) <br>
= 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 <br>
= 51/126 <br>
= 17/42
